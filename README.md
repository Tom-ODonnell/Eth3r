# Eth3r
A work-in-progress custom firmware tool... a sn0wbreeze alternative.

This project was taken over from [here](https://github.com/TKO-Cuber/eth3r) by my friends and I, and will probably be rewritten from scratch by us.


# What this tool can do

This tools is planned to be a wrapper of xpwn and iBoot32Patcher, giving it the potential to make a custom firmware for all iOS versions iOS 2-10.

## Upcoming Features
  Make custom firmwares for iOS 2-10 (requires bootrom exploit to utilize, however)
  Verbose boot on all supported versions
  Jailbreak (iOS 6.1.3 to start)
